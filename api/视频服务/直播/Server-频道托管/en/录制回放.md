## Features
Recording playback means that you can record the entire LVB process and view them as VOD programs, as shown below:

At the early launch stage of the App, because of the relatively small number of VJs, adding recording playback in the broadcast list can increase to some degree App resources at the viewer end. Even when VJs increase to a certain scale with APP growth, accumulation of good LVB contents is necessary. In the personal statement of each VJ, in addition to the name, photos and personal information, video history is also an essential part.

## Enabling Service
The recording and playback function relies on the support of the backend cluster of Tencent Cloud VOD service. If you need this function, you need to activate the VOD service on Tencent Cloud console.

## Enable Recording
Specify an LVB channel and start recording. In this solution, the **record** parameter is added to the end of the push address, for example, record=flv or record=MP4 (videos only in the FLV and MP4 format can be recorded before October 2016).

## File Generation
The recording system stores an LVB video as one fragment every 30 minutes (adjustable, it can be adjusted to 90 minutes) during LVB. The recording ends if the LVB ends. The transcoding and writing of the last recorded file are completed 1-2 minutes after the LVB ends.

The video file generated during LVB is stored in the Tencent Cloud VOD system. You can find it in the video list in the VOD system.

## File Query
If you need to launch campaign LVB and one or two campaigns are carried out one day, you can manually query the recorded video files in the VOD console.

If you are developing an LVB APP and need to store historical LVB video files and present them to APP users in the playback list, you need to call the Tencent Cloud server APIs on your server for automatic handling.

Currently, the server API provided by Tencent Cloud is [GetVodRecordFiles](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5823). You need to set only the **Channel ID** and ** Start Time** (it is recommended to set it to LVB start time). Then, you can query **fileid** of all files recorded by a specified channel after a specified time point.

After **fileid** is obtained, you can call the API [DescribeVodPlayUrls](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/257/1285) of the VOD platform to obtain the video play URL.

> **Best query time**
> 
> The operation of periodically calling GetVodRecordFiles to query channels one by one is not economical and can be easily rejected by Tencent Cloud because of access frequency limit. Then, what is the best query time?
>
> If your server solution is designed in the mode recommended in the [Channel Hosting] (https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5659), it is best to query the channel 2 minutes after the LVB ends (involved in Step 3 and Step 6). The reason why you need to wait <font color='red'>**2 minutes**</font> is that the handling of Tencent Cloud internal files takes about 1-2 minutes.

## Video Playback
A play URL can be generated after your server obtains a recorded file. After obtaining the play URL, the APP sends it to the VOD play module of the RTMP SDK to play back the recorded file. For the interworking, see "VOD SDK (iOS)" (https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/4738) and [VOD SDK (Android)](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/4739).

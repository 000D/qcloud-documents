API name:  CreateRecord

Note: Recorded files are stored on the VOD platform. If you want to use the recording function, you need to activate a VOD account first and then ensure that the account is available. After a recording file is stored, relevant fees (including fees generated by storage and downstream play) are charged according to the VOD platform. For details, refer to "Corresponding Documents". (https://www.qcloud.com/doc/product/266/%E4%BB%B7%E6%A0%BC%E6%80%BB%E8%A7%88).

Recording rules
1) The record task is started when the task time is up and it is ended when the LVB is ended.
2) Record is fragmented based on time. The longest recording time is 0.5 hour.
3) Record is stopped and a fragment is generated in case of a stream interruption.
A new task is started to repeat the preceding steps after the stream is recovered.
Fragmentation request URL: http://(VOD bizid).vod.myqcloud.com/(vid).f0.flv

## Compatibility Description
Initially, the LVB code solution is an LVB solution designed by Tencent Cloud for VIP customers. It can be activated only after an internal application is submitted not long ago. Therefore, in the initial design of the solution, there is no requirement for compatibility with [Channel Hosting](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5659).

Confirm the following points before enabling the LVB code mode:
(1) **Your online business does not rely on channel hosting**. If you always use the channel hosting mode, incompatibility will impose many difficulties to you after switching.
(2) **You do not use a large number of interactive LVB services**. The bypass LVB of interactive LVB uses the channel hosting mode and many incompatibility issues will be incurred after switching.


## Enabling the LVB Code Mode
### 1. Enable the LVB service.
Access Tencent Cloud [LVB Console](https://console.qcloud.com/live). If you have not activated the LVB service, activate it first.

### 2. Switch to the LVB code mode.
If you see a green dot in the upper right corner of your channel access after activating the LVB service and entering **LVB management interface**, you are in the channel hosting mode.

Click the **Enable LVB ID** button, and you can see a compatibility tip. If your online business is dependent on the channel hosting mode, it is not recommended to enable this service. Then you enter the configuration interface:

### 3. Configure key parameters.
Before you can enable the LVB ID mode, you need to define four configuration items as shown above:

| Configuration item | Value range            | Description  |
|----------|----------------------|--------------|
| LVB recording | On or Off | After LVB recording is enabled, all LVB programs will be recorded by the backend by default. [References](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5691) |
| Push hotlink protection key | 32-character lowercase string | For security reasons, the push address needs to be bound to hotlink protection in order to avoid being preempted by someone else. The key is used to calculate the hotlink protection signature. [References](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5693) |
| API authentication key | 32-bit lowercase string | Your server needs to provide authentication information when calling the Tencent Cloud backend API. The key is used to help Tencent Cloud determine the valid identity of your server. [References](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5956) |
| Callback URL | HTTP URL address | Tencent Cloud will send the stream interruption and other events to you via this URL. The HTTPS protocol is not supported currently. [References](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5957)  |

### 4. Activate the service.
Click the **OK** button to switch your Tencent Cloud LVB service to the LVB ID mode. The page with the LVB ID mode enabled is as follows:

You will notice two significant changes on the page:
(1) The LVB ID access (recommended) tab becomes active
(2) At the top, a bizid number appears, which is used to assemble the push address. For details, see [References](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5649#. E6.8E.A8.E6.B5.81.E5.9C.B0.E5.9D.80).

### 5. Use auxiliary tools and code.
The page with the LVB ID mode enabled also provides an **address generator**, used to facilitate your URL test, because manual calculation of the hotlink protection signature is very difficult.

At the bottom, the page also provides php and java two versions of push address generation codes. You can embed them in your backend program.

## Returning to Channel Mode
After enabling the LVB code mode, if you find that the mode is not applicable to you, you can return to the channel hosting mode as follows: On the **Channel Access** tab page, click "Enable Channel Access".

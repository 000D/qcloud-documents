## 2.1 Entering Console

The LVB console is the customer-oriented control center of Tencent Cloud video service. Click "Here"(https://console.qcloud.com/live) to enter it. It contains the following function items:

- **Manual Channel Management**
The LVB console provides a set of user-friendly interactive interfaces. LVB channels can be manually created, managed or deleted. This mode is called channel mode, applicable to routine management operations of lightweight customers with a small number of channels, for example, customers engaged in LVB activities.

- **Configure LVB Code**
"LVB Code" is a short name for the backend API of LVB service of Tencent Cloud. Fast access of LVB Code depends on the configuration of some key setting items, and such configuration is in the LVB console.

- **Statistic Analysis**
The information such as bandwidth consumption and number of online users in the past period of time can be viewed by multiple time dimensions so that you can understand your service status.  Meanwhile, the customer using the RTMP SDK of Tencent Cloud can selectively enable a special quality zone to master the quality of every LVB stream.


## 2.2 Manual Channel Management
**LVB Channel** is also called "LVB stream" or "studio". The LVB console provides a set of user-friendly interactive interfaces, and LVB channels can be manually created, managed or deleted. This mode applies to routine management operations of lightweight customers with a small number of channels:

- **View Channel List**
>After entering the LVB console, click the LVB button in the sidebar. If you are in the channel access mode (as indicated by the red mark of the following figure), you can directly view the current channel list, as shown below:

- **Create a Channel**
>If you are in the channel access mode, click the "Create Channel" button (https://console.qcloud.com/live/livecreate) to create an LVB channel (studio). If there is no special requirement, select the original video for the coding, and do not set watermark, thus achieving the best experience effect.

>
>Besides, it is preferred to select the two options of video streaming protocol. Based on our experience, since the expected watch protocol is not selected, a lot of customers reports the problem that LVB video cannot be played during debugging.

- **Ban Specified Channel**
> An LVB channel can be disabled directly on the channel list, namely, the channel is banned. After being banned, the channel will not continue to process the audio and video data pushed by the video source.

- **Real-time Preview**
> Click the **Test** button on the channel list to preview the LVB video picture in real time to check the LVB effect.

- **Share Channel Address**
> On the channel list, click the **Share Address** button to obtain a connection URL for sharing outside. This URL can be propagated through a social tool and applies to LVB activities.
>
>However, the corresponding page of this URL is relatively simple. If you want to implement more powerful sharing capability, please refer to section 7: "WeChat Sharing"(https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/6450).

## 2.3 Configuring LVB Code

### 2.3.1 Definition of LVB Code
**LVB Code** is a short name for the backend API of LVB service of Tencent Cloud. Different from the design objective of manual channel management in section 2.2, LVB Code aims to enable your backend server program to perform channel management operations on Tencent Cloud automatically in all weathers:
- **Independently Define Push and Play Addresses**
In the LVB Code access mode, you do not need to apply for push or play URL to Tencent Cloud, but can specify one independently, for example, most customers directly combine users' account IDs into a push URL to implement push.

- **More Suitable for Development of LVB Apps**
In the LVB Code access mode, Tencent Cloud mainly processes the audio and video related functions such as push, transcoding, CDN distribution, recording, and security protection, and the parts such as status, list, and address are opened completely, without too many restrictions and interventions.  You can independently implement the needed service scenario or use the backend API of Tencent Cloud to get channel information. This highly free mode applies to this relatively complicated LVB application scenario of LVB App.

### 2.3.2 Switching to LVB Code Mode
If you see a green dot in the upper right corner of your channel access after activating the LVB service and entering **LVB management interface**, you are in the channel hosting mode.
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/dd67f3bae42d2c5df6deefe5d5f7e091/image.png)

Click the **LVB ID access (recommended)** tab, and you can see the switch to enable the LVB ID service:
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/5a33cf2173f1b39c458e3da7fa808bc9/image.png)

Click the **Enable LVB ID** button, and you can see a compatibility tip. If your online business is dependent on the channel hosting mode, it is not recommended to enable this service. Then you enter the configuration interface:

### 2.3.3 Configuring Key Parameters
Before you can enable the LVB ID mode, you need to define four configuration items as shown above:

| Configuration item | Value range            | Description  |
|----------|----------------------|--------------|
| LVB recording | On or Off | After LVB recording is enabled, all LVB programs will be recorded by the backend by default. [References](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5691) |
| Push hotlink protection key | 32-character lowercase string | For security reasons, the push address needs to be bound to hotlink protection in order to avoid being preempted by someone else. The key is used to calculate the hotlink protection signature. [References](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5693) |
| API authentication key | 32-bit lowercase string | Your server needs to provide authentication information when calling the Tencent Cloud backend API. The key is used to help Tencent Cloud determine the valid identity of your server. [References](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5956) |
| Callback URL | HTTP URL address | Tencent Cloud will send the stream interruption and other events to you via this URL. The HTTPS protocol is not supported currently. [References](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5957)  |

### 2.3.4 Confirming to Activate Service
Click the **OK** button to switch your Tencent Cloud LVB service to the LVB ID mode. The page with the LVB ID mode enabled is as follows:
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/1400072859844bc1fa5dcf45bfa205c1/image.png)

You will notice two significant changes on the page:
(1) The LVB ID access (recommended) tab becomes active
(2) At the top, a bizid number appears, which is used to assemble the push address. For details, see [References](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5649#. E6.8E.A8.E6.B5.81.E5.9C.B0.E5.9D.80).

### 2.3.5 Auxiliary Tool and Code
The page with the LVB ID mode enabled also provides an **address generator**, used to facilitate your URL test, because manual calculation of the hotlink protection signature is very difficult.
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/7fe2bd6e762c1e109f77f36853b9749e/image.png)

At the bottom, the page also provides php and java two versions of push address generation codes. You can embed them in your backend program.

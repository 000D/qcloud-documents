## 1.1 Experiencing Small LVB
Small LVB is an LVB App (software prototype) implemented based on Tencent Cloud service. By experiencing this App, you can generally learn the functions that can be implemented using Tencent Cloud service and how about the experience of these functions. 

The terminal, backend and Web end "Source Code" (https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/6164) of this App can all be provided to you for reference. Meanwhile, all the documents of this section will frequently combine all kinds of scenarios in Small LVB to introduce the implementation principle behind it.

## 1.2 Experiencing RTMP SDK
In addition to Small LVB (built based on RTMP SDK), we also provide another Demo of simplified version specially focusing on the RTMP SDK. It aims to help you to understand the specific processes of push, VOD and LVB more easily.

The Demo of simplified version provides a lot of functional buttons in the toolbar at the interface bottom. Each functional button is corresponding to one basic function of the SDK. During experience, you can enable or disable the specific function.

RTMP push is exclusive; <font color='red'>only one VJ can</font> implement push at the same time for the same URL.  Therefore, if you experience frequent disconnection of push (rejected by the backend), the address has been by used by other experiencers. You are recommended to activate the LVB service of Tencent Cloud and create your own channel for experience. The specific method is as follows:

**"New Address"**

1. Log in to "LVB Console"(https://console.qcloud.com/live). If you ever activated LVB service, you will enter the channel management page directly. If you log in for the first time, the system will guide you to activate LVB service, and allocate free traffic of 10 G to you for experience.

2. If you have activated LVB service, enter "LVB Management"(https://console.qcloud.com/live/livemanage), and click **Create Channel**: 
 
3. Enter the channel name, channel description and LVB source name as required. Check "Original Video" only for "Real-time Transcoding", select "Not Use Watermark" for "Watermark Settings", and select RTMP/FLV in "Receiver Settings".

4. After saving, the system directly goes to the channel detail page just created. Copy the push address and play address, and generate QR codes for use respectively:

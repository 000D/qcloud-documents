### 1. What do push, LVB, and VOD mean?
- **Push**
   It refers to the process that a VJ pushes the local video/audio source to Tencent Video Cloud server. It is also called "RTMP publishing".
	 
-**LVB**
   It refers that viewers directly watch audio/video data pushed by a VJ in real time. The time gap between viewers and the video source is not too long.
	 
- **VOD**
   Video sources are stored on the Tencent server in advance. Viewers can watch them at any time. This is similar to Youku, Tudou, iQIYI, and Tencent Video websites.

### 2. What are common LVB protocols?
There are three common LVB protocols: Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP), Flash Video (FLV), and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).
- **RTMP**
RTMP can be used for both push and LVB. It fragments large video/audio frames, and transmit the fragments as small data packets to the Internet and encrypts data to increase security. However the packet assembly/disassembly processes are complex and may bring some unexpected stability issues in the case of mass concurrent connections.
	
- **FLV**
FLV is released by Adobe and features simple format. It only adds some header information to the headers of video frames and audio frames. Its simple structure provides users with low latency and high availability under mass concurrent requests. Though it doesn't work well on mobile browsers, it's very suitable to be used as mobile App LVB protocol.
	
- **HLS**
HLS is a solution launched by Apple. It divides a video into 5-10s video fragments, and then uses the m3u8 index table for management. Videos downloaded to the client are all complete data of 5-10 seconds. Therefore, the videos are played very smoothly but very long latency (generally about 10-30 seconds) is incurred. Compared with FLV, HLS is supported by most iPhone and Android browsers. Therefore, HLS is usually used in URL sharing of QQ and WeChat.

### 3. What are common VOD protocols?
There are three common VOD formats: MP4, HLS, and FLV.
-  **MP4**
MP4 is a classic file format, which is supported by most mobile devices (via built-in browsers) and PC (via FLASH control). However the format and index table of MP4 video files are complicated, which brings slow loading speed for large MP4 files (e.g. over 30 mins).

-  **HLS**
HLS is a standard launched by Apple. It is well supported on mobile browsers. But you need to go extended development for FLASH to make this protocol available on IE. HLS uses the simple m3u8 index structure to increase indexing speed. It is a good choice for VOD.

-  **FLV**
Developed by Adobe, FLV is the most commonly used encapsulation format on the LVB platforms. It is strongly supported by the Flash player on PCs. But a special player is required to play FLV files on mobile Apps. Most mobile browsers do not support FLV. Tencent Cloud LVB uses FLV format for recording.

### 4. What are common push protocols?
  RTMP is the major protocol for Push service (pushing from VJ to the server).

### 5. What features and protocols does Tencent Video Cloud SDK support?
  Tencent Video Cloud SDK supports Push, LVB, and VOD features:
  - **Push**: Supports RTMP protocol, and provides features like hardware acceleration, beauty filters, bandwidth adaptation and definition adjustment.
  - **LVB**: Supports FLV and RTMP protocols. FLV protocol is recommended, as it is capable for Instant Broadcasting, automatic latency control and hardware decoding.
  - **VOD**: Supports the online VOD service of MP4, HLS and FLV files.

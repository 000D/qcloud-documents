### 1. How can I implement Instant Broadcasting?
**Instant Broadcasting**: Once the video starts playing, the viewers can watch the video right away.

Instant Broadcasting is only available when SDK is in **Speed** and **Auto** modes. In Smooth mode, Instant Broadcasting is not supported because of the forced buffer logic.

### 2. How do I keep a balance between video quality and data usage?
The video quality is affected by **resolution**, **frame rate** and **bit rate**.
- **Resolution**: Currently, Tencent Cloud RTMP SDK supports three 9:16 common resolutions: 360\*480, 540\*960, and 720\*1280.

- **Frame rate**: If FPS <=10, the view gets stuck obviously. Nevertheless, a higher frame rate does not indicate better effect. In general, 20 FPS is recommended and the play is smooth.

-**Bit rate**: It refers to the data volume coded by the encoder every second, in units of kbps. For example, 800 kbps means that the encoder will generate 800kb data per second.

**Keep the balance among the resolution, frame rate, and bit rate to get good quality**:
- **Bit-rate: set a reasonable limit**
High resolution and frame rate provide viewers with better LVB experience, but also higher big-rate and higher costs.
   
- **20 FPS is enough**
For a fixed bit rate, like 800 kbps, the higher frame rate means lower resolution, as the codec needs to compromise the resolution for more frames. For video sources captured via mobile cameras, 20 FPS is enough.
  
- **Set a reasonable resolution**
 For a fixed bit rate, like 800 kbps, high resolution will pose difficulties to the coder. As a result, the color information reduction, pixelation, or whatever may be introduced so as to bear more pixelation points.

 If you're not familiar with audio/video coding, it's recommended to use parameters set in the demo. We provide settings for 3 levels of quality (720p, 540p, and 360p) in the demo.


### 3. How can I reduce delay and stuttering?
**Delay** here refers to the time lag between the VJ and the viewer, and **stuttering** refers playback stops over 500ms.
Video playback quality is affected by network condition. 
  ![tx_live_service_lag](http://qzonestyle.gtimg.cn/qzone/vas/opensns/res/img/tx_live_service_lag.jpg)

The cloud service and client App introduce buffering to ensure smooth playback, however it will inevitably cause longer delay.
Therefore high delay means high playback quality and low delay brings lower quality. You need to keep a balance between them. Take HLS protocol for example, it introduces 10-30 seconds of delay to achieve a smooth playback.

Tencent Cloud provides three latency control solutions:
-**Auto**: Select this mode if you don't have a specific scenario.
  > When the setAutoAdjustCache switch in the player is turned on, the automatic mode is selected. In this mode, the player will, based on current network conditions, automatically adjust delay. By default, the player will automatically adjust delay in the 1s - 5s range (you can also use setMinCacheTime and setMaxCacheTime to modify the default values), to minimize the VJ-viewer delay while ensuring sufficient smoothness, and therefore to guarantee a good interactive experience.

-**Speed mode**: applicable to scenarios requiring low latency
  >Set SetMinCacheTime and setMaxCacheTime to 1s. 

-**Smooth mode**: mainly applicable to the**game LVB**and**VOD** and other scenarios which have strict delay requirements.
  > Set "setAutoAdjustCache" to "No" to activate Smooth mode. In this mode, when the video gets stuck, the player enters the loading state till the buffer area is full, then the player enters the playing state till it encounters irresistible network fluctuation. By default, the cache is 5s, which you can change using setCacheTime.


### 4. I've set setVideoFPS to 30FPS, but the actual frame rate is 20FPS.
 
- **Hardware restriction**
  The camera ports of some Android devices do not support 30+ FPS data collection frequency. This issue is very serious on front-facing cameras of many Android devices.

- **Low codec performance** The video codec of the device is not capable to process the LVB

- **Solution**
  For 360 * 640 quality, software code can implement 30 FPS in most high-end and mid-range Android mobile phones. For a higher resolution, it's recommended to use hardware code. See [Android RTMP SDK Hardware Codec](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/4734#step-7.3A-.E7.A1.AC.E4.BB.B6.E7.BC.96.E7.A0.81). .

- **20 FPS is enough**
  If the video source is captured via mobile cameras, 20 FPS is enough in most scenarios. Higher frame rate is applicable only to animation scenarios simulated using 3D models and real-time computing such as mobile game LVB.

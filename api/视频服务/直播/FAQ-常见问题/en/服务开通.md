### 1.6 Querying the API Access Authentication Key
API access authentication keys are required when your backend server calls [Cloud APIs](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5956) relevant to Tencent Cloud LVB code. Such keys aims to help Tencent Cloud confirm the calling legitimacy. API access authentication keys can be specified during enabling of the LVB code mode, and can be changed as required on the [LVB Console](https://console.qcloud.com/live).

### 1.7 Querying the Event Callback URL
An event callback URL is an address from your backend server. When Tencent Cloud needs to notify your backend server of some [LVB-relevant Events](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5957), Tencent Cloud sends notifications to this address in the form of HTTP POST. The event callback URL can be specified during enabling of the LVB code mode, and can be changed as required on the [LVB Console](https://console.qcloud.com/live).

## 2. Video on Demand (VOD)
### 2.1 Activating the VOD Service
Each new Tencent Cloud that passes verification has seven days of trial use. After the trial period expires, you need to only purchase required packages on the [VOD Console](http://console.qcloud.com/video).
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/07fc20e09b0a527089cc9d48d27669cc/image.png)

### 2.2 Querying the VOD APPID
Each Tencent Cloud account has a unique VOD APPID, which is placed in a hidden place on the [VOD Console](http://console.qcloud.com/video), and at least one uploaded or recorded video file needs to exist under your account. See the following figure:
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/7e1ba9d016cb55e3825b980b5de5987a/image.png)


## 3. Instant Messaging (IM)
### 3.1 How to activate the IM service
Go to [IM Console](https://console.qcloud.com/avc). If you do not have the service, just click the **Directly activate IM** button. For a Tencent Cloud account, the IM App list is empty, as shown below:
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/c033ddba671a514c7b160e1c99a08b55/image.png)

Click the **Create App access** button to create a new App access, that is, the name of the App that you want to access Tencent Cloud IM service. Our test App is called "small LVB demo", as shown below:
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/897bff65af6202322a434b6fa3f8a0bd/image.png)

Click the OK button, then you can see in the App list the item you just added, as shown below:
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/1c1cb2c2fa4c6f0dc7be06bf8329dee3/image.png)

### 3.2 IM SDK APPID
In the preceding figure, the SDKAPPID column displays Tencent Cloud IM service ID, which is used to determine the interworking APP of a Tencent Cloud customer. It is often used when the APP is interworked with the IM SDK.

### 3.3 IM SDK Account Type
In the list in the preceding figure, there is an **Application Configuration** button. Click it to make configuration, as shown in the following figure:
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/d52ac3662d5310673a5d6c6a78f50da4/image.png)

Many configuration items are available here, most of which are not important. You may not configure them or just modify them as needed at any time. For example,
- ** Account Name**
You can enter the account name at discretion but avoid use special characters.

- **Verification Mode**
Currently, only System Generates Pubic Key is available. Therefore, you do not need to configure this item.

- **Account Administrator**
Account administrator is a UserId for debugging. If you are an engineer, you can enter your common account ID. It is used when the advanced features of the IM service are used.

- **Verification SM Signature**
This item is the prefix of the SM text. You can enter the APP name.

- **Integration Mode**
If you have no very urgent special requirements, <font color='red'> the independent mode is not recommended. </font>

| Integration mode | Applicable scenario | Interworking difficulty | Design goal |
|------------|-------------|-------------| -----------|
| Guest (hosted) mode | Suitable for scenarios with rather low **identity verification requirements**, such as the LVB chat room scenario that allows all App users to join.  | Log in to the IM SDK using the guestLogin mode, and the interworking cost is extremely low.  | The design goal is to reduce interworking cost, so that you can use the IM services without interworking with the account system. Tencent Cloud will generate for each App user a <font color = "blue>"Guest Account"</font> , The account will only be used to send and receive messages. |
| Independent (authentication) mode | Suitable for clients with high **identity verification requirements**. For example, only registered users of your App can send and receive messages.  | The UserSig security signature is required and interworking cost is relatively high. | The design goal is to assign the permission for sending and receiving messages to the client. It needs your login server to confirm the legitimate identity of App user and then allocate signatures. Tencent Cloud checks the authenticity of signatures before allowing them to send and receive messages. This guarantees that all message senders and receivers are accounts in your account system. |

Click **Save** to complete the IM message access configuration for the APP. Then, AccountType is generated. See the following figure:

## 4. Cloud Object Storage (COS)
### 4.1 How to activate the IM service
Users can use the Cloud Object Storage (COS) service immediately after being assigned authenticated Tencent Cloud accounts. You only need to access the [COS Console](https://console.qcloud.com/cos) to create a bucket to enable the COS service.
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/0ce694618801bdf841df883b7fb8d764/image.png)

### 4.2 What Is Bucket?
Bucket is a technical term, which can be simply understood as **disk partition**. For example, the COS service purchased from Tencent Cloud can be compared to a new hard disk that you purchase from JD.COM and you often partition and format the hard disk before storing any data to the hard disk. One partition that you create on the hard disk can be understood as one bucket that you create on Tencent Cloud COS.

### 4.3 Querying Bucket Name
The name that you specify during bucket creation is a bucket name. For example, in Example 4.1, xiaozhibo is a bucket name.

### 4.4 Querying the COS APPID
Click [Key Management](https://console.qcloud.com/cos/project) on the COS console. The COS APPID is displayed, which must be bound with one pair of APIs.
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/60a3a35c5a28603a5ef730a2fd436677/image.png)

### 4.5 Querying the COS SecretId and SecretKey
Click [Key Management](https://console.qcloud.com/cos/project) on the COS console. SecretId and SecretKey bound with the COS APPID are displayed. They are used by APIs for accessing the COS because the COS is a cloud service that has very high security requirements. Therefore, if an API fails to transfer a correct key, Tencent Cloud will reject the request of the API.

## 5. Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM) (Optional)
You can use your own server as the business server for deploying the backend script. Tencent Cloud CVM is recommended for deploying the backend script because Tencent Cloud CVM is more professional and stable. In addition, if you select the Cloud Database of Tencent Cloud as the distributed database, Tencent Cloud CVM must be set up for accessing the database.
Access the [CVM Console](https://console.qcloud.com/cvm/overview), and click "Purchase CVM" to access the CVM purchase page:
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/9e479e479a8a6cc72678881f400eefd4/image.jpg)
Click "Next" to access the image selection page. You are recommended to select a Linux image with nginx+php+mysql from the CVM market.
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/84b60f7ab5e966aed54325a7a2b71beb/image.jpg)
Complete subsequent operations as prompted. The CVM becomes available after the image operations are completed.

## 6. Cloud Database (Optional)
### 6.1 Activating the Cloud Database
Access the [Cloud Database Console](https://console.qcloud.com/cdb). If you have not activated the CDB (MYSQL) service, click "New".
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/138c9dd9d5793920aa539141567e0be6/image.jpg)
![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/62c41e4dbde3eb4f906955e9ebd5cca6/image.jpg)
**Note: You must use the Tencent Cloud account that is used to activate the CVM to activate the Cloud Database service, and select the area same as the area of the CVM.**
After purchase, the instance is displayed in the "instance list". Click "Initialize" to set the string set and password for the Cloud Database.

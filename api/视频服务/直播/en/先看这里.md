Welcome to Tencent Cloud LVB service. This chapter describes how to construct a set of reliable LVB solution based on Tencent Cloud. 

## Backend Zone
This section describes the backend APIs that are used to formulate a Tencent Cloud LVB solution. The APIs fall into two types based on functions: 
- **For proactively querying and managing live stream status**  
   The APIs are called to query required information or control live stream. The following table lists the APIs:

| API                                | Function |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| [Get_LiveStat](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/6110) | Query Statistics - push and playback information |
| [Get_LivePushStat](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/6110) | Query Statistics â€“ push information |
| [Get_LivePlayStat](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/6110) | Query Statistics - playback information |
| [Live_Channel_GetStatus](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5958) | Queries status information for a channel (old version API) | 
| [Live_Channel_SetStatus](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5959) | **Ban** a stream, mainly used for the pornography checking| 
| [Live_Tape_GetFilelist](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5960) | Query the list of files **recorded** during the broadcast of a channel | 
| [Live_Queue_Get](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5961) | Query the list of **screenshot files** for a channel during the broadcast| 

- **For receiving event notifications from Tencent Cloud**  
If a critical event occurs on the Tencent Cloud backend service cluster, the event will be sent to the customer server by means of "Event Notification"(https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5957). Customers should register for the URL for receiving event notifications on the Tencent Cloud. The following table lists the types of event notifications supported currently:

| Event type   | Function |
|:-------------------------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 | A live stream interrupts | 
| 1 | A live stream starts or resumes| 
| 100 | A new recorded file is generated | 
| 200 | A new screenshot file is generated | 

## Terminal Zone
This section mainly describes the mobile terminal solution of Tencent Cloud LVB solution. Tencent Cloud RTMP SDK provides a set of high-quality implementation solution to pushing, LVB, and VOD services for mobile terminals, allowing users to integrate LVB and VOD services of high-quality audio and video by a few lines of code. 

| Document Name | Function Description |
|---------|----------------|

## Web Page Zone
This section describes how to use the Tencent Cloud Web SDK and all the functions of the Web SDK, providing support if you share videos and broadcast video in online mode. 

- **Platform differences** 
The supported protocol and implementation protocol of the Web SDK varies with platforms. 

| Browser Platform | Supported LVB Protocol | Supported VOD Protocol| Player Implementation Solution |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Windows | FLV, HLS | HLS, MP4   | Based on the flash browser plugin |
| iOS & Android | HLS | HLS, MP4 | Based on the HTML5 capability |

- **Code interworking**
It is difficult to determine a LVB or VOD service simply based on the video address. Tencent Cloud Web SDK falls into live version and VOD version:
  + "Web LVB Player Interworking Document"(https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5704)
  + "Web VOD Player Interworking Document"(https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/5706)

- **WeChat Sharing**
For WeChat, QQ, Sina Weibo, and other social tools, Web SDK provides a simple all-in-one Web solution which can implement LVB experience that is similar to that provided by applications. For details, refer to "WeChat Share" (https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/258/6450).

## Channel Hosting (Old)
Channel hosting is an access solution launched by the video service of Tencent Cloud in the early stage. This solution provides a set of graphic LVB channel management solutions in the form of Web page, as well as a set of corresponding backend APIs. 

At present, the graphical Web page is still the favorite of many LVB activity customers due to its clear interface and simple operations. However, the backend API exposes the drawback of maintenance difficulty as the customer's service logic becomes complicated. Therefore, it is not recommended for the access mode through the backend API.

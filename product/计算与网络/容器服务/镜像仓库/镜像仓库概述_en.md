## Image Warehouse Overview
Image warehouse is used to store Docker images which are used to deploy CCS. Each image has a unique ID (image's Registry address + image name + image Tag).

## Image Type
Currently, official Docker Hub images and private user images are supported. Tencent Cloud community images will become available soon.

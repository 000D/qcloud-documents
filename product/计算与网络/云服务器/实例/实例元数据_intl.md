Instance metadata refers to the data of the instance that you operate on, and can be used to configure and manage running instances.

>Note: Although instance metadata can only be accessed internally from the instance, the data has not been protected through encryption. Anyone who accesses the instance can view its metadata. Therefore, you should take proper precautions to protect sensitive data. For example, using permanent encryption key.

## Instance meta-data
Tencent Cloud provides the following meta-data information:

| Data | Description | Introduced Version |

## Querying Instance Metadata
Operations on the instance metadata can only be performed **internally within the instance**. You first need to log in to the instance. For more information, please see [Log in to Windows Instance](/doc/product/213/5435) and [Log in to Linux Instance](/doc/product/213/5436).

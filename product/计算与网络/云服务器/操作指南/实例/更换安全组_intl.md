Security Group is a virtual firewall that allows state-based packet filtering. As an important network security isolation tool of Tencent Cloud, it is used to set network access control for one or multiple Cloud Virtual Machines. When creating a CVM instance, you must configure the security group for it. Tencent Cloud supports configuring a new security group for the CVM instance after it is created.


>**Note:**
>If you want to configure a new security group for the instance, create a security group first. For more information, please see [Create Security Group](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/12450).

## Purchase history
Purchase history supports displaying your recent **10** purchase records. With it, you can achieve one-key purchase of the same configuration, to simplify the purchase path. 

- Supports pulling your recent 10 purchase records.
- Select the configuration you want to purchase. After passing the configuring check, go directly to Step 3 of the purchase page and simply configure the CVM settings (purchase quantity, duration, host name, password, security group) to complete the purchase.
- If the configuration/image in purchase history is off shelve, the configuration check fails. Try to purchase another configuration.

>Note: Currently purchase history for postpaid services is not supported. Please look forward to feature upgrades.

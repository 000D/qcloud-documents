Before sending SMS messages using Tencent Cloud SMS service, you need to create an application first. After the application is created, you can get the SDK AppID and App Key. The former is the unique identifier of the application, and the latter is the password for verifying the validity of the SMS request.
Note: The Appkey for the SdkAppID should be kept confidential.

In addition, you can also set the frequency, add alarm contacts, configure callback and manage blacklist for the SMS application on the application management page.

## Adding Application
Log in to Tencent Cloud [SMS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sms).
- Complete identity verification for your Tencent Cloud account if you have not already done so. For more information, please see [Identity Verification Guide](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629). You can skip this step if your Tencent Cloud account has gone through identity verification.

### Configuring Frequency Limit

1. For SMS messages with the same content, a maximum of one such message can be sent to the same phone number within 30 seconds.
2. A maximum of 10 SMS messages can be sent to the same phone number in one calendar day.

### Alarm for Excess Delivery on a Single Day
Tencent Cloud SMS provides alarming service to send you a notification when the number of messages sent on each calendar day exceeds the limit.

**How to configure:**
In the **Application Configuration** -> **Basic Configuration** page, click **Set** in the **Alarm for Excess Delivery** tab to select alarm condition and enter a corresponding value, and then click **OK**.

### Configuring Callback
To make it easier for customers to keep good track of the information about the SMS messages sent, Tencent Cloud SMS service provides powerful callback capability. For example, if a callback URL for SMS receipt status is configured, after receiving the callback message from the operator, Tencent Cloud will push the callback message to the specified callback URL immediately. Currently, Tencent Cloud SMS service supports callbacks for SMS status, SMS reply and voice messages.
**How to configure:**
In the **Application Configuration** -> **Basic Configuration** page, click **Set** in **Event Callback Configuration** tab, select the callback as needed and configure the callback URL. After the configuration is completed, click **OK**.

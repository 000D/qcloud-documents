## How to Obtain Transfer Code from the Original Registrar?
A transfer code (auth-code) must be obtained from the original registrar when you transfer a domain name. For registrars outside China (such as Godaddy), auth-code can be sent to the email of the domain name owner with a click on a button on the control panel. While there is usually no such feature for registrars in China, you need to contact the registrar where you registered your domain name or the registration agency and ask for the transfer code manually, or request for domain name transfer. Usually, they can provide you with the transfer process.
If you purchase your domain name from an agency of a registrar (www.net.cn or www.west.cn), when the agency refuses to provide the transfer code, you can send a complaint to its registrar. If the registrar does not cooperate, send your complaint to ICANN, CNNIC or other registries.
According to the regulations of domain name administration authorities (ICANN Domain Name Transfer Policy), the original registrar cannot refuse or restrict the transfer of domain name without authorization, nor ask for any extra fee for any reason. If the original registrar does not follow the regulations, the domain name owner can submit a complaint by filling in the [Transfer Complaint Form (http://www.icann.org/en/resources/compliance/complaints/transfer/form).

If your international domain name transfer did not succeed, some reasons are as follows:
- Domain name status is not "ACTIVE" or "OK". If domain name's "STATUS" is not "ACTIVE" or "OK" when queried via the WHOIS system, the domain will not be successfully transferred to Tencent Cloud.  In this case, contact the original domain name registrar to restore domain name status to "ACTIVE" or "OK" (or unlock the domain name).
- Original registrar refuses the request for transfer. Contact the original registrar and complete the procedure for domain name transfer, and then submit a request for transferring domain name to Tencent Cloud at Tencent Cloud.
- Domain name has expired. Contact the original registrar and renew your domain name, and then submit a request for transferring domain name to Tencent Cloud at Tencent Cloud.
- Domain name admin email is invalid. Contact the original registrar and change the domain name admin email to a valid one which is able to reply to verification emails in time.
- Transfer confirmation email is not replied in time. After you submit an application for international domain name transfer to Tencent Cloud and confirm the transfer, the original registrar will send you a confirmation email for your domain name transfer-out with a time limit. Domain name transfer will not succeed if you don't reply to this email in time.
- The original domain name admin email is changed after transfer application is submitted. The new email does not receive the confirmation email for transfer, as the email has been sent to the original admin contact email.
- The transfer fails immediately if you entered an incorrect transfer code.
- Contact your original domain name registrar to obtain the transfer code, as Tencent Cloud is not able to obtain it for you.

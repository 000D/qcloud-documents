There are two ways to connect to Redis:
* You can access the Redis instance via the private network URL, port, instance ID and instance password using the CVM in the same region. The high-speed private network ensures a low latency. You're recommended to refer to the user guide that contains the [Sample Codes](/doc/product/239/PHP链接代码示例) for connection in different languages. You can also refer to [Service Limits](/doc/product/239/使用限制) for a better understanding of the product features.
* You can also log in to Redis instance from web with the instance password via the data management entry in the instance details using an auxiliary management tool that can manipulate instance data by simulating command lines.

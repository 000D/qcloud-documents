In this step, you need to create a Web server connected to Tencent Cloud's CDB for MySQL instance created in [Step 1: Create a CDB](/document/product/236/8470).

### 1. Create a Linux CVM
First, you need to create a Linux CVM according to the tutorial [Getting Started for Linux CVMs][1] and [Deploy the application environment][2].

### 2. Install the MySQL Client in the Linux CVM
You can log in to [MySQL official website][3] to download and install the client.

### 3. Access CDB for MySQL Service
To access CDB for MySQL service, you can directly connect the instance's private network address in the same CVM as that of the MySQL.
For detailed MySQL statements, refer to [MySQL Manual][4].

### 2. Comparison Between "Postpaid" and "Prepaid" Payment Mode
|| Before Switching (Postpaid) |	After Switching (Prepaid) |
|--|--|--|
| Comparison of Modes |	Current postpaid billing on a monthly basis.  |	New monthly or annual prepaid method.  |
| Purchase |	The amount for one month will be frozen, but will not be deducted; complicated to comprehend.  |	The amount will be deducted directly based on the selected usage period.  |
| Monthly Settlement |	Carry out monthly settlement for last month on the 5th day. Unfreeze the frozen amount of the last month and deduct the actual amount based on the actual usage days and freeze the amount for current month.  |	No monthly settlement process. |
| Cloud Cost Budge |	Charge based on the actual usage days, which may result in inaccurate budget and is difficult to plan. |	Use after purchase, which makes the budget clear and easy.  |
| Renewal |	No renewal; the cloud database shall be returned if not used.  |	There is an expiry time for cloud database. Renew it before the expiry time to purchase further usage period. |

### High Elasticity
* Powerful hardware ensures high performance
>PCI-e SSD's powerful IO performance guarantees access to the database
>A maximum of 37,000 QPS and a maximum storage space of 1TB are supported

* Flexible billing options
>The billing model of annual or monthly plan is provided. You can make a payment for the database services for one month or several months at a time based on the business needs, so as to avoid a significant one-time investment in the infrastructure construction.

* Read/Write separation
>Read-only instances can be mounted to CDB for MySQL. "One Master, Multi-Slave" architecture allows you to respond to massive requests. RO group featured with cloud load balance is supported to greatly simplify the process of pressure distribution among slaves.

### Security
* DDoS protection
> When a user suffers a DDoS attack, this feature can help him/her resist various attack traffic, ensuring the normal operation of businesses.

* Protection against database attack
> Effectively defense against such database attacks as SQL injection, and brute-force attack.

* Highly reliable storage
> Provide online master/slave data storage service to ensure the security of online data. Meanwhile, backup data can be stored for several days using backup mechanism for data recovery in the event of disaster.

### Availability
* Real-time hot backup
* Real-time master/slave hot backup; lossless recovery within 3 days; cold backup data dump within 5 days

* Automatic disaster recovery
> Provide services of automatic failure detection and automatic failover. Procedures of master/slave switchover and failover are transparent to users.

### Easy Usage
* Easy management of massive databases
>You can manage the cloud database by using either command line or web; batch database management, permission setting and SQL import are supported.

* Data import and backup rollback
>Provide multiple means of data import for initialization. Data will be backed up automatically on a daily basis; rollback can occur in cloud database at any point in time within 3 days based on backup files.

* Professional monitoring and alarm
>Provide services of multi-dimensional monitoring, and custom resource threshold alarm; slow query analysis report and full SQL operating report can be downloaded.

* A variety of connection methods
>Public network access and VPC network are supported. You can connect the cloud database with IDC, private cloud or other computing resources via these methods to apply them in a hybrid cloud environment

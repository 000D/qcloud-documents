## System Overview
A complete MLVB solution consists of three aspects: device, backend and web page. These three aspects need to work together to construct a close-loop solution.

Mini LVB App is a demonstration prototype created by Tencent Cloud video terminal development team, aiming to provide a whole set of reference source codes that include basic features such as VJ stream push, viewing, recorded video playback, interactive messaging, "liking", on-screen commenting and so on. You can [Obtain the Service](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/mlvbsdkdownload) for free as long as you are a verified user of Tencent Cloud and have activated LVB service.

It's difficult to reduce the cost for learning and using source codes. In this section, we will segment the major features of Mini LVB and introduce them separately, to reduce your interfacing cost and R&D workload as best as we can.

## Major Features

### Part. 1 Live Room List
Live Room List is an essential component if you are not the kind of customer who only have one event LVB channel at a time. The Mini LVB App is for external demonstration, so there are few rooms that are broadcasting at the same time. We mixed the LVB list with VOD playback list to make the whole list look more filled.

### Part. 2 Push & Playback
The RTMP SDK of Tencent Cloud is able to implement push, LVB and VOD on mobile device within a day. These three features all follow one single principle: **driven by simply using one URL (push URL, LVB URL or VOD URL)**.

### Part. 4 Record Playback
Record playback means you can record the LVB process as a VOD video and play it later. The number of VJs is often small at the early stage of introduction of an App. Adding record replay feature in the LVB list can give more information on the App to viewers. The Mini LVB App is for external demonstration, so there are few rooms that are broadcasting at the same time, thus it also adopted this interaction method.

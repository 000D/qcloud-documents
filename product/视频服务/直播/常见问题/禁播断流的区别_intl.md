## 1. Stream Interruption
If a live stream is interrupted, this push will also be interrupted. Thus viewers will not be able to watch the live broadcasting. After the interruption, VJ can initiate the push again to continue the live streaming.

## 2. Stream Suspension
If a live stream is suspended, this push will also be interrupted. Thus viewers will not be able to watch the live broadcasting. After the suspension, VJ cannot initiate the push again within a certain period of time. The period of stream suspension can be set at the console with the maximum length of not more than one month.
For example: At 2018-01-01 12:00, you've set stream suspension for **test123**. The end time for suspending broadcast is 2018-01-05-12: 00. During this period, the VJ for test123 cannot push stream and viewers cannot watch this live broadcasting.

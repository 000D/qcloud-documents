If a user wants to purchase cloud services but his/her Tencent Cloud Account has a balance less than 0, the user needs to top up the account first. It is highly suggested that the user top up the account before using any cloud service resources in order to avoid service suspension due to outstanding bills. Most of our cloud services are billed hourly and may cause service suspension if account balance is negative. 

Users can top up the account by using PayPal or by making Bank Transfers directly into our bank account.

Tencent Cloud is the first domestic enterprise to attain dual ISO9001 China National Accreditation Service for Conformity Assessment (CNAS) and ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB) certifications pertaining to cloud computing. 

ISO9001 is derived from the first global quality management system standard, namely, the BS 5750, formulated by the BSI. To date, it is the most sophisticated quality management framework, one that systematically provides assurance as to the product quality and operations of a company. In addition, it also provides guidelines and structure to the entire process of planning, implementation, improving and realization of a companyâ€™s products and services, ensuring that customer satisfaction and compliance with laws and regulations are achieved.

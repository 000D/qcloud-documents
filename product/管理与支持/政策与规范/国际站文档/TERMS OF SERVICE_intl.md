## 22.	GENERAL

22.1	These Terms set out the entire agreement between you and us in relation to Tencent Cloud and Tencent Cloud Software – you agree that you have not relied on, and will have no claim against us for, any statement which is not explicitly set out in these Terms. The words "include" and "including" are to be construed without limitation. The invalidity of any provision of these Terms (or parts of any provision) will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision (or the remaining parts of that provision). If a court holds that we cannot enforce any part of these Terms as drafted, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under applicable laws and regulations, without changing the remaining terms of these Terms. No delay in enforcing any provision of these Terms will be construed to be a waiver of any rights under that provision. Any rights and obligations under these Terms which by their nature should survive, including any obligations in relation to the liability of or indemnities (if any) given by the respective parties, will remain in effect after termination or expiration of these Terms. 

22.2	No person other than you and us will have any right to enforce these Terms, whether pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Ordinance, any other statutory rights in your jurisdiction or otherwise. You may not delegate, assign or transfer these Terms or any rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may freely assign or transfer these Terms or our rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without your prior consent or any notice to you. We may freely sub-contract any part of our performance of these Terms at any time, without your consent or any notice to you.

the following terms apply:

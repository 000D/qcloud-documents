- Cloud Monitor is available to all users with a Tencent Cloud account.

- Currently, the monitoring data can be retained for 30 days. You can check the monitoring data within the last 30 days.

- We set a maximum of 1,000 alarm messages for each user per month. If this number cannot meet your demand, please submit a ticket to increase the limit.

- When an alarm is sent, if the exception is not handled, the alarm will not be sent again later. For example, the alarm trigger condition of CVM `1.1.1.1` is CPU utilization > 80% for 5 minutes. If you don't handle the exception when such an alarm is triggered, the alarm will not be triggered until you resume it.

## Step 2: Configure CNAME

1. Once the domain name configuration is completed, the system will assign the corresponding DSA domain name to you, which should be suffixed with .dsa.dnsv1.com:

2. You need to complete CNAME configuration at the DNS service provider of the connection domain name, to add a CNAME record to the DSA domain name. To learn about how to configure it, please click [CNAME Configuration Instruction](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/product/228/3121);

3. Verify if domain name CNAME is in effect: The time needed for the CNAME to take effect varies for different DNS service providers (usually within 30 minutes). You can also check whether a CNAME is in effect by using PING. If you are directed to the domain name suffixed with ".dsa.dnsv1.com" by using PING, the domain name CNAME is already in effect.
